# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System with Trailer and Sentiment Analysis

The primary goal of this project is to design and deploy an intelligent movie recommendation system that enhances user content discovery, improves engagement, and delivers personalized entertainment experiences while maintaining cost-efficient and scalable infrastructure. The project aims to solve the challenge of overwhelming content libraries by leveraging machine learning techniques to recommend relevant movies based on user interests, movie metadata, and similarity analysis. Additionally, the system integrates user interaction features such as reviews and search behavior to support data-driven personalization and continuous improvement of recommendation accuracy. From a business perspective, the solution was built to improve user retention, increase platform engagement time, optimize infrastructure resources through model compression and FAISS indexing, and provide actionable user preference insights that can support strategic decision-making, content acquisition planning, and competitive advantage in digital entertainment platforms.

## 💼 Business Value & Strategic Impact

In today's digital landscape, users face overwhelming content choices—a challenge this project directly addresses through **content-based filtering (CBF)** . Unlike collaborative filtering that relies on other users' behavior, CBF recommends movies based on their actual attributes (director, cast, genres), creating a personalized experience that drives engagement and platform growth.

## 🧮 Cosine Similarity

**The Heart of Movie Recommendations**
Cosine Similarity is a metric that measures how similar two movies are by calculating the cosine of the angle between their feature vectors. In simple terms, it answers the question: "Do these two movies point in the same direction based on their attributes?"

If two movies have identical features → Angle = 0° → Similarity = 1.0 (perfect match)
If two movies share no common features → Angle = 90° → Similarity = 0.0 (no relation)

**Why It's Critical for This Project:**
Unlike traditional search that looks for exact matches, Cosine Similarity captures semantic relationships between movies. It enables the system to:

- Recognize that Inception and The Dark Knight are similar—even though they have different titles—because they share Christopher Nolan as director and share genres like "Action" and "Sci-Fi"
- Focus on meaningful patterns rather than exact keyword matches
- Provide diverse yet relevant recommendations by understanding underlying themes

This approach transforms raw metadata (director, cast, genres) into intelligent, human-like recommendations that feel curated rather than algorithmic.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1.  **Data Collection**:
    - **Static Dataset Ingestion**: Cleaned, merged, and preprocessed multiple IMDb datasets (`credits.csv`, `movie_metadata.csv`, `movies_metadata.csv`, `reviews.csv`) to build a comprehensive foundational movie database covering early-year releases.
    - **Real-Time Data Augmentation**: Integrated The Movie Database (TMDB) API to enrich the static dataset with up-to-date metadata, including live vote averages, popularity scores, trailers, and high-resolution posters for enhanced user experience.

2.  **Model Training (Sentiment Analysis)**:
    - Analyzed and preprocessed **50,000 IMDb reviews** (25,000 positive + 25,000 negative)
    - Trained multiple algorithms: **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Linear SVC**.
    - Selected the best-performing model for production to ensure accurate sentiment classification.

3.  **Recommendation Engine & Optimization**:
    - **Vectorization**: Used TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical vectors.
    - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied **TruncatedSVD** to reduce the feature space. 
    - **Indexing**: Implemented **FAISS** index to enable fast similarity searches, solving the challenge of deploying large similarity matrices on limited cloud storage.
4.  **Trailer Fetching & Playback**:
    - **Backend**: `get_trailer()` method queries TMDB API for movie videos, prioritizes official trailers, and returns YouTube keys.
    - **Frontend**: Dynamic modal with embedded YouTube player, loading states, and auto-play functionality for seamless user experience.

## 💡 Professional Handling: Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Deployment Limitation Due to Large Model File Size
**Problem:** The trained recommendation model (`.pkl`) and similarity matrix exceeded the storage limits of the free-tier Render hosting, causing build failures.

**Solution:**
- Optimized storage by implementing **FAISS** for indexing instead of loading the full similarity matrix.
- Applied **TruncatedSVD** to reduce dataset dimensionality, creating a lighter, production-optimized model.
- Successfully deployed the system while maintaining recommendation accuracy.

### 2. Performance Optimization Using FAISS Indexing
**Problem:** Brute-force cosine similarity on large vectors resulted in slow query responses and high latency.

**Solution:**
- Replaced brute-force search with **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**.
- Built a vector index enabling approximate nearest neighbor search.
- Significantly reduced query latency, enabling real-time scalable recommendations.

### 3. Integrating Cosine Similarity with Flask
**Problem:** Aligning data preprocessing, model loading, and real-time query handling created sync issues and potential crashes.

**Solution:**
- Implemented robust validation checks before querying the index.
- Added graceful fallback messaging for missing movies.
- Optimized data serialization to prevent memory spikes during runtime.

### 4. TMDB API Integration & Synchronization
**Problem:** Asynchronous API calls for metadata, posters, and trailers led to incomplete page loads and synchronization issues.

**Solution:**
- Designed structured **AJAX request chains** for sequential data loading.
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and loading indicators (spinners) to improve UX.
- Ensured consistent UI rendering even if partial API data fails.

### 5. Handling Null or Missing Metadata
**Problem:** Critical identifiers (like IMDb IDs) returning null values caused review submission errors.

**Solution:**
- Added hidden form validation and defensive backend logic.
- Improved template data binding to prevent data corruption.
- Ensured data consistency across user sessions.

### 6. Internal Server Errors During Reviews
**Problem:** Server crashes during review submission due to improper form handling.

**Solution:**
- Implemented structured error logging.
- Validated all form parameters server-side before database insertion.
- Strengthened Flask route exception handling for stability.

### 7. Performance Bottlenecks from API Calls
**Problem:** Sequential external API calls increased page load times.

**Solution:**
- Optimized request flow with efficient data batching.
- Implemented a robust in-memory caching layer within the TMDBService class. This system stores API responses for 24 hours, significantly reducing redundant network requests.
- Reduced redundant calls and implemented caching strategies where possible.
- Improved user retention through faster load times.

## ⚙️ Production Optimization & Scalability
One of the most critical engineering decisions in this project was optimizing the recommendation pipeline for production deployment. By reducing model artifact size and implementing FAISS-based similarity indexing, the system was transformed from a research prototype into a scalable, real-time recommendation platform capable of operating efficiently under infrastructure constraints.
